# par-sir
**Parallel SIR Stokes synthesis from MURaM cubes**
**par-sir** is tested and optimized for HPC MPI execution using gfortran and Intel compilers
with support for batch job submission in PBS and Slurm.

**par-sir** is derived from, and depends upon,
the [3d_sir code](https://github.com/aasensio/3d_sir): Copyright (c) 2018 Andrés Asensio Ramos
The 3d_sir code is included as a submodule of **par-sir** with code overlays in the synth subdirectory.

## Installing par-sir
### source code mods to 3d_sir

The par-sir mods directory contains source code tree with all the par-sir modifications to 3d_sir.
After cloning the repo you can run build_3d_sir.sh to copy the par-sir modifications into
the 3d_sir source hierarchy and automatically compile and install 3d_sir.
Be sure to "conda activate SIR" or use pip to configure your local env to meet the 3d_sir requirements. 

## Using par-sir
### Configuration
Edit synth.ini to include a template for the desired lines.
Use ##6302## as a template.
Other configuration settings of note:
-  [Atmosphere] **Type** = 'MURAM' tells par-sir the input is a MURAM cube
-  [Atmosphere] **XYZ** = ordering of the axes e.g. 1,0,2 means cube axes 0,1,2 are solar Y,X,Z
sphere]

### Scripts
The script "synth.sh" can be used to automatically create a cube specific ini file from the synth.ini template. 
This is useful when running a pipeline on an HPC cluster.

### Synthesis
Run synth.py to synthesize Stokes profiles for a MURaM cube. e.g.
- `mpiexec -n 36 python synth.py --init=synth-038817-15648.ini`
- `python synth.py --init=synth-038817-15648.ini`

### Visualizations
The **stokesplot.py** python program produces various plots:
- Single wavelength spatial Stokes profile image (specify WL and I, Q, U or V)
  - `python stokesplot.py -V --colormap=inferno --path=stokes-038817-15648.h5`
- Single pixel Stokes profile plots (specify pixel y and x)
  - `python stokesplot.py --px=100 --py=100 --path=stokes-038817-6302.h5`
- Polarization butterfly plots for a single line (specify column x)
  - `python stokesplot.py --slice=100 --path=stokes-038817-6302.h5`

## Release Notes v1.0.2
### solar abundances of atomic alements
The 3d_sir code includes a data file "THEVENIN" with solar abundances from Grevesse (1984):
	Abundances quoted by THEVENIN and taken from Grevesse, 1984, Physica Scripta, Vol.T8,49-58.
	Abundances for Na,Mg,Al,Si,K,Ca,Sc,Ti,V,Cr,Mn,Fe,Co,Ni,Cu,
	Zn,Ge,Sr,Y,Zr,Nb,Mo,Ru,Rh,Ba,La,Ce,Pr,Nd,Sm,Eu,Gd,Dy,W and Ir from Holweger
	as quoted by Thevenin, 1989, Astron. Astrophys. Suppl.Ser 77, 137-154.

It appears that for 3d_sir to avoid I/O overhead which is indeed a problem for MPI performance,
the initialization of abundances from the file THEVENIN has been commented out.
The values from THEVENIN are hard-coded in leyendo.f and interface.f90.

For our project we use the abundances from Grevesse (1998):
	Abundances are taken from Grevesse, N., Sauval, A. Standard Solar Composition. Space Science Reviews 85, 161–174 (1998).
	Abundances for As, Se, Br, Kr, Te, I, Xe, Cs, Ta, Re, Hg, Bi, Th are determined from meteorites.

We have changed the hard-coded values in leyendo.f and interface.f90 and provided the Grevesse (1998) values
in the currently unused data file "ABUNDANCES".

### changes to model.py and multiprocessing.py
One significant modification to these two files.
1. Changing the h5 dataset schema

## Release Notes v1.0.1
### spectral line configuration
3d_sir includes a data file "LINEAS" to define each available line to synthesize.
To synthesize the 1565nm Fe lines the LINEAS file and interface.f90 were updated
with the following integer and half-integer spin encodings:
- S:0 P:1 D:2 F:3 G:4 H:5 I:6 K:7 L:8 M:9 N:10 O:11 Q:12`
- p:1/2 f:3/2 h:5/2 k:7/2 m:9/2 o:11/2 r:13/2 t:15/2 u:17/2 v:19/2 w:21/2`

## Helper scripts
The script "synth.sh" can be used to automatically create a cube specific ini file from the synth.ini template. 
This is useful when running a pipeline on an HPC cluster.

### changes to model.py and multiprocessing.py

One significant modification to these two files.
1. Replacing the interpolated atmosphere with the values from the MURaM cube


## Release Notes v1.0.0
### MURaM cube and 3d_sir axes
The **MURaM** simulation uses a solar Y, X, Z reference frame. This is the order the axes are written to disk.
The 3d_sir ini file parsing has been modified to allow explicit declaration of the ordering in the cube
of the solar cartesian coordinate axes.  The configuration below specifies 
Solar Y (+=North,-=South) is MURaM axis 0,
Solar X (+=West,-=East) is MURaM axis 1 and
Line of Sight (Z) is MURaM axis 2. 

- **Type** ` Type = 'MURAM'`
- **XYZ** `XYZ = 1, 0, 2`
- **Dimensions** `Dimensions = 1536, 1536, 128`

### changes to model.py and multiprocessing.py

There are two significant modifications to these two files.
1. Parsing the configuration file for new configuration settings
1. Reordering the axes to be consistent with solar coordinates and optimum for Python
